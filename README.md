This contract is a crowd funding to hire Geohot for the job.
The logic will be:
   - anyone can chip in using donate()
   - anyone can withdraw their donation while the
     contract is still pending undonate()
   - only geohot can withdraw the funds using:
     iAmGeoHotAndICommitToDeliverCheckpointingToCheapETH()
   - geohot can only withdraw if the 20k target is met.  And
     he will get all the funds, possibly more than 20k
